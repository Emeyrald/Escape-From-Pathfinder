As you lay idle, dreaming, the ship shakes, and you 
get thrown out of your bed, onto the floor. Red klaxon 
alarms start blaring in your room. You get up, albeit 
with some trouble, and try to remember where you are. 
You finally remember that you're on a ship, The Pathfinder. 
You go to a terminal in your room, and switch the screen 
to a camera that faces away from the back of the ship. 
You see... an Imperial Star Destroyer. You think to 
yourself, "I need to get out of here now".
