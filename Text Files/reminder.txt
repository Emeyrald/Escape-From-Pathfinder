Room and object descriptions are always complete; 
never any need to LOOK AT or EXAMINE any object. 
In any room, if directions into other rooms are 
given, then the list is complete: no other compass 
directions lead anywhere. Thus, if a room description 
ends with "There are doors to the north and south," 
then there is no reason to try going east.
