You get in the escape pod and close the door. You 
sit down, and the escape pod shoots out of its slot. 
You turn around to start working on the systems of 
the escape pod. After you configure the life support 
systems, you see a bright light reflecting off of 
the front window, and you look behind you, only to 
see the remains of The Pathfinder.
